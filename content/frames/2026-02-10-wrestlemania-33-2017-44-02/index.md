A frame from WrestleMania 33 (2017) at 44:02. Two wrestlers stand in a WWE ring during a segment themed "Welcome Festival of Friendship," with one holding a microphone wearing a sparkly jacket and fedora, while the other stands shirtless across from him. The backdrop features festive Las Vegas-style signage with Canadian maple leaf imagery.
