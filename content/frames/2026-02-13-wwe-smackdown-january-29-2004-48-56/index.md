A frame from WWE SmackDown (January 29, 2004) at 48:56. Two men sit at a table in what appears to be a backstage area, with one wearing a green jacket on the left and another in an "Airborne" t-shirt and black cap on the right. A pink container and WWE graphics are visible on the table, with curtains and medical equipment in the background.
