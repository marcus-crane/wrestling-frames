A frame from WWE Raw (March 12, 2007) at 14:14. A WWE wrestling match is underway in a packed arena, with multiple shirtless wrestlers competing in the ring while a referee officiates. Banners reading "Money in the Bank" and "Qualifying Match" are visible ringside, and the enthusiastic crowd fills the stands with signs and cheers.
