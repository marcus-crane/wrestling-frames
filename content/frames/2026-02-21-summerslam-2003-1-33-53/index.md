A frame from Summerslam (2003) at 1:33:53. Two WWE wrestlers engage in combat within the ring during SummerSlam 2003, with one competitor in patriotic red and blue attire facing off against another in black. The packed arena crowd watches intently from the stands, with the WWE logo visible on the ring apron.
