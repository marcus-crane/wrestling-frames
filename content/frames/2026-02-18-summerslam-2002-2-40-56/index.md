A frame from Summerslam (2002) at 2:40:56. A shirtless wrestler lifts his opponent overhead in the wrestling ring at SummerSlam 2002, with a referee in a striped shirt observing nearby. The packed arena is visible in the background beneath bright stadium lights, with the SummerSlam logo displayed on the arena signage.
